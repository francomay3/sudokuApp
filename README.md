# Sudoku App

Welcome to Sudoku App, a fun and interactive way to play sudoku puzzles on your browser. Sudoku App is built with vite, react, typescript, and lodash. It lets you generate new solved sudokus, fill them in the app, and check for mistakes in real time. Sudoku App is still under development, so most of these features are not available yet. You can find more information about the app below.

## Future Features

- Generate new solved sudokus of different difficulties
- Fill the sudokus in the app
- Write notes in the cells to help you solve the sudokus
- Check for mistakes in real time with a color-coded feedback system
- Reset or clear the sudokus anytime you want
- Save or load your progress with local storage

## Installation

To install Sudoku App, you need to have node.js and npm installed on your machine. Then, follow these steps:

- Clone this repository to your local machine
- Navigate to the project folder and run `npm install` to install the dependencies
- Run `npm run start` to start the development server
- Open `http://localhost:5173/` in your browser to see the app

## Future Usage

To use Sudoku App, simply select the size and difficulty of the sudoku you want to play, and click on the "Generate" button. A new generated sudoku will appear on the screen, with some cells already filled and some empty. You can fill the empty cells by clicking or tapping on them, and selecting a number from the keypad.<br>
to add notes to a cell, simple switch to the "Notes" mode by clicking on the "Notes" button, and then click or tap on the cell you want to add notes to. You can add or remove notes by clicking or tapping on the numbers in the keypad. You can switch back to the "Fill" mode by clicking on the "Fill" button.<br>
The app will show you if your input is correct or not by changing the color of the cell. Green means correct, red means wrong, and yellow means unsure. You can also use the "Hint" button to reveal a random cell, or the "Solve" button to show the complete solution. You can reset or clear the sudoku by using the buttons at the bottom of the screen. You can also save or load your progress by using the buttons at the top of the screen.
